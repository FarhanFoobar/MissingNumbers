# MissingNumbers

## Prerequisites

* An array contains random collection of numbers.
* Numbers are between 1 and 99 (both included).
* There are no duplicates.
* The array is sorted in ascending order.

## Example

Example: [1,2,7,9,55] -> 3-6,8,10-54,56-99


Write a function which will return all numbers in the range of 1 to 99 which don't exist in this array.  
The output should be sorted in ascending order separated by commas  However, any consecutive missing 
numbers in the result should be grouped in a range (example: 2,3,4 should be written as 2-4).
